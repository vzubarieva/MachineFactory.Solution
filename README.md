#### By: Viktoriia Zubarieva

## Description

This is web application which can help to keep track of machine repairs. This MVC web application is managing engineers, and the machines they are licensed to fix. The factory manager can add a list of engineers, a list of machines, and specify which engineers are licensed to repair which machines. There is a many-to-many relationship between Engineers and Machines. It shows that engineer can be licensed to repair (belong to) many machines (such as the Dreamweaver, the Bubblewrappinator, and the Laughbox) and a machine can have many engineers licensed to repair it.
